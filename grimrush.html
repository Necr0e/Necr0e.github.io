                        <p>Grimrush is a isometric action rpg boss rush game where you select one of three characters and then fight bosses one at a time, and after each victory you get the ability to either buy a new skill or upgrade a pre-existing one.</p>

                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/704760/Grimrush/">Grimrush</a> started as a school project as a <a href="https://pelipaja.centria.fi/">Game Lab</a> project where we had one year to make a game, and while we succeeded - we felt that the game had potential so we continued to work on it in our spare time for the next two years.  Our team consisted of three programmers.<br><br />
                        I primarily worked on the backend tools such as the skill system (which went through three iterations from a massive Path of Exile inspired skill web, which turned out to be too confusing for most players to what we use today where each skill has two upgrades.<br /><br />
                        I also developed Unity tools that helped streamline the addition of new skills and abilities. The goal was to develop Unity UI elements that would allow the other developers to quickly add new items, select their icon and give them a description as well as stats without opening a single script file.<span class="image right"><a href="Images/Grimrush/screenshot1.jpg"></a><img src="Images/Grimrush/screenshot1.jpg" alt="" target="_blank" /></span><br />This in hindsight feels kind of a waste as while it would have been helpful if we had continued using the skill web, it wasn't nearly as necessary once we more to a two upgrade system.<br /><br />
                        I also helped with miscellaneous work whenever needed such as doing the groundwork for the bermuda level (see right).<br /><br />
